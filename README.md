# Code Em - Winter 2018  

## Introduction    

**Project Based --** The objective for this class is to learn by doing; specifically through working on projects. By creating your own projects, you will learn new skills and harden concepts you already know. Essentially, you will set a goal for yourself, learn as you go, and we'll work towards that goal together.  

We will use class time to get help on projects.
