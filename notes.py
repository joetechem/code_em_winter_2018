# 1/9/18 - Class 1
        # 5 students made it to first class
        # at least one sign up did not show
        
        # normal introductions
        # started class with a intro to a project-based approach to learning
        # proposed several project ideas
        # brainstorm activity to decide on project(s) to work on during the 12wks
                # Anaya:
                        # create own version of slither.io (pygame)
                        # Learn Pythn programming language
                        # possibly look into hyperpad as well
                # Mattias & Tyler:
                        # Java Minecraft Mods
                        # Create a robot using pi, python, 3d printing
                        # Alexa skill: "alexa, rap or sing a famous song"
                # Taixi & Matthew:
                        # Minecraft server on pi w/ mods

        # Need a way to bring some of these ideas together, so the instructors
        # are not spread too thin, e.g. be able to teach similar concepts to
        # more than one group at a time that will still relate to each project idea
